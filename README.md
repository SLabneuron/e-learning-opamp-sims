# Welcome to e-learning: Op-Amp sims

Our simulator provides a dynamics, user-friendly platform for mastering the intricacies of operational amplifiers,
with a current focus on first-order active filters. 
It's perfect for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to deepen their understanding of electronics through interactive learning.

## Quick Start
To get started with the op-amp simulator:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 and above installed on Windows 11.
2. Close the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required libraries using 'pip install library-name' (ex. pip install numpy).
4. Run the main application file to launch the simulator.

We're committed to continuous improvement and eagerly await your suggestions and contributuions. Thank you for being a part of our learning community!

### Environments (recommended)

- Windows 11  
- Python 3.9 and above

### Libraries

- os  
- numpy  
- tkinter  
- matplotlib  

## On goning Work

We are currently working on the following features:

- Input funtionality for experimental value.
- Save feature for the current state of simulators.
- Expansion of filter types available in the simulator.
- Intuitive filter design features like Ltspice
- Addition of passive filters for educational purposes.
- Enhancement of graphic for a more polished user interface.
- Addition of a feature to display slopes in dB/octave and dB/decade on the console.
